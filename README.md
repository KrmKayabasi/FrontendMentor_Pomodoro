You can try the challenge yourself --> [FrontendMentor_Tracking Intro Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G)

Live Demo is available --> [Demo](https://splendorous-sfogliatella-e68162.netlify.app/)


Note1: This project is not fully functional. FontChange,ThemeChange and MinuteChange is not available. I will add these features as soon as possible. But you can change values on code and use it on your own computer for a while.

Note2: It doesn't work on the background. I will solve this issue too.
